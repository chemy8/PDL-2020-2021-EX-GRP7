Good coverage due to low frequencies,Good coverage indoors on 850/900 MHz. Repeaters possible. 35 km hard limit.,"Unlimited cell size, low transmitter power permits large cells","Unlimited cell size, low transmitter power permits large cells",Smaller cells and lower indoors coverage on 2100 MHz; equivalent coverage indoors and superior range to GSM on 850/900 MHz.,Smaller cells and lower coverage on the S band.,Dense cells on millimeter waves.,Signal quality/coverage area
Very low density,0.2 MHz = 8 timeslots. Each timeslot can hold up to 2 calls (4 calls with VAMOS) through interleaving.,Lower than CDMA-2000?,1.228  MHz = 3Mbit/s,5 MHz = 2 Mbit/s. 42Mbit/s for HSPA+.
